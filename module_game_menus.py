    "Star Wars: Conquest - FAQ & Notes^^This mod is still in development. We hope to eventually add more models, factions, quests, complete scene editing for all scenes, and add other functionality. Please post any bugs or suggestions on our forum.^^Content for this mod and future changes will primarily be focused on the original movies, Episode 4-6 range.  Clone Wars era troops and equipment have been included but are not planned to be further improved or a major feature of this mod.^^Scene editing is still in progress and we have made changes to many of the major planets like Tatooine, Yavin IV, Naboo, Geonosis, Ryloth, Kashyyyk, and Endor.  We are also working on creating several generic scenes to use for battlestations, outposts, and smaller planets. This is still a work in progress so not all scenes have been modified yet.^^The Trade Federation Base has several merchants like a Force-Sensitive Trainer, Clone Wars Era Merchant, Droid Parts Merchant, Plastic Surgeon, and others. Their inventory refreshes every hour and they can also randomly appear in the cantina's.^^Clone Troopers, B1-Series Battledroids, Baby Rancors, and Force-Sensitive troops can be recruited by building village upgrades.^^Space Battles can be found at the Training Academy.  Improving the controls or this functionality is a lower priority but may be reviewed in the future.^^Heavy Weapons (rocket launcher, flame rifle, etc) and some force powers (force kill, force knockdown, etc) are include for fun but are overpowered and will unbalance the game if you choose to use them.^^Currently some spaceships can be purchased and upgraded at the Trade Federation base and we plan to add more later.^^It is possible to get droids from Jawa prisoners but currently these droids do not do anything in battle.^^We could use help with this mod with models, textures, scene editing, and coding. Please post on our forum if you are interested in helping.^^Thanks very much to everybody who has directly or indirectly contributed to this mod, we all appreciate it.",
